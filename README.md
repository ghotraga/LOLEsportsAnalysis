League Of Legends Esports Predictions and Analysis

We created 3 main AI models and 2 supplementary models which predict specific things like what champion could have been played with this composition, what the result of a specific composition would be with detailed statistics, etc. 

The League of Legends esports scene is already one of the most watched esports around the globe while only coming into the limelight 10 years ago. It is viewed regularly by millions live at the stadiums or through video streaming websites like Twitch and Youtube. The prize pools for winning tournaments, sponsorships, and even salaries of players on top teams can stretch in the millions. Even though there has been 10 years of continuous growth for this scene, it has shown no signs of stopping and continues to grow year over year. Only looking at the popularity for the biggest tournament of every year for the game; ‘The World Championship’. This tournament pits teams from across the world against each other to find out the top team. Compared to any other esports tournament, the World Championship is by far the most popular and watched. Based on the popularity, viewership, and overall year over year growth we saw an opportunity to introduce artificial intelligence to this field. We decided to create AI models that will help teams find out the most important areas to focus on.
